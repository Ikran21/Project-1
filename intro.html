        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>This project will focus on creating a visually appealing Go Fish game interface using only HTML and CSS. This game will include CSS transitions and animations for card flips, shuffling, and other visual effects. We will simulate different game screens, such as a homepage, game board (with player hands and card deck), settings, and an end-game screen.</p>
